The first click on the Show Add button in the ContactTable
does not show the add section!?

Ivo:
The 1st time Show Add is clicked the text is not 'Show Add' but something like '\n             Show Add\n  '.
That's why it doesn't work as expected.

<button id="show-add" class="button" on-click="show">
  Show Add
</button>

->

<button id="show-add" class="button" on-click="show">Show Add</button>

ContactTable component has contacts
  @published contacts contacts;
that are passed to it when the component is used:
  <template>
    <contact-table contacts="{{contacts}}"></contact-table>
  </template>

contactAdd component has contacts
  @published contacts contacts;
that are passed to it when the component is used:
  <template if="{{showAdd}}">
	<contact-add
	  contacts="{{contactss}}">
	</contact-add>
  </template>

Are the two contacts the same object?
Yes (almost sure).

If a contact is added to the second contacts,
how to refresh the first contacts?

The contacts, when first used, must be observed.
In polymer_app.dart:
does not work: contacts = toObservable(contactLinksModel.contacts);
what works:
contacts = contactLinksModel.contacts;
contacts.internalList = toObservable(contacts.internalList);
In repeat="{{contact in contacts.internalList}}":
you cannot use contacts.toList();
you must use contacts.internalList.

contact_edit.html
input field: value="{{contact.description}}"
cannot change the value !?

Use a non-composite property:

@published String description;

  enteredView() {
    super.enteredView();
    description = contact.description;
  }

html:  value="{{description}}

To try: add @published in front of description property in the model.

Tried, did not work:

@published
class Contact extends ConceptEntity<Contact> {
  @published String description;

value="{{contact.description}}"
